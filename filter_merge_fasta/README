This C program was originally written to filter proteins that are shorter than a minimum allowed length and have more stop codons than a maximum allowed percentage. The program takes one fasta file per species and merges proteins from all the species into a single file. A map file that provides the species IDs and descriptions can be provided as a second input, otherwise the program autogenerates this file and uses the autogenerated species IDs. Tip: Once this program autogenerates the file, you can edit the species IDs as desired and re-run the program.

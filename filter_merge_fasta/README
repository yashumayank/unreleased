This C program filters out the proteins that are shorter than a minimum allowed length and have more stop codons than the allowed percentage. The program takes one fasta file per species and merges proteins from all the species into a single file. A map file that provides the species IDs and descriptions can be provided as a second input, otherwise the program autogenerates this file and uses the autogenerated species IDs. Tip: Once this program autogenerates the file, you can edit the species IDs as desired and re-run the program.
The C code uses only base libraries and can be compiled as: 

```
gcc filterNmerge_protein_fasta.c -o filterNmerge_protein_fasta
```
